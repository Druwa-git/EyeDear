# Gaze Tracking

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This is a Python (2 and 3) library that provides a **webcam-based eye tracking system**. It gives you the exact position of the pupils and the gaze direction, in real time.

_🚀 Quick note: I'm looking for job opportunities as a software developer, for exciting projects in ambitious companies. Anywhere in the world. Send me an email!_

## Installation

Clone this project:

```
git clone 
```

Install these dependencies (NumPy, OpenCV, Dlib):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> The Dlib library has four primary prerequisites: Boost, Boost.Python, CMake and X11/XQuartx. If you doesn't have them, you can [read this article](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-dlib/) to know how to easily install them.

Run the demo:

```
python eyedear.py
```

## Simple Demo

```python
import cv2
from gaze_tracking import GazeTracking

while webcam.isOpened():
    # We get a new frame from the webcam
    _, frame = webcam.read()

    # We send this frame to GazeTracking to analyze it
    gaze.refresh(frame)

    frame = gaze.annotated_frame()
    text = ""

    if gaze.is_blinking():
        text = "Blinking"
    elif gaze.is_right():
        text = "Looking right"
    elif gaze.is_left():
        text = "Looking left"
    elif gaze.is_center():
        if gaze.is_up():
            text = "Looking upward"
        elif gaze.is_down():
            text = "Looking under"
        else:
            text = "Looking center"

    cv2.putText(frame, text, (90, 60), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_DUPLEX, 1.6, (147, 58, 31), 2)

    left_pupil = gaze.pupil_left_coords()
    right_pupil = gaze.pupil_right_coords()
    cv2.putText(frame, "Left pupil:  " + str(left_pupil), (90, 130), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_DUPLEX, 0.9, (147, 58, 31), 1)
    cv2.putText(frame, "Right pupil: " + str(right_pupil), (90, 165), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_DUPLEX, 0.9, (147, 58, 31), 1)

    cv2.imshow("Demo", frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) == 27:
        break

```

### Refresh the frame

```python
gaze.refresh(frame)
```

Pass the frame to analyze (numpy.ndarray). If you want to work with a video stream, you need to put this instruction in a loop, like the example above.

### Position of the left pupil

```python
gaze.pupil_left_coords()
```

Returns the coordinates (x,y) of the left pupil.

### Position of the right pupil

```python
gaze.pupil_right_coords()
```

Returns the coordinates (x,y) of the right pupil.

### Looking to the left

```python
gaze.is_left()
```

Returns `True` if the user is looking to the left.

### Looking to the right

```python
gaze.is_right()
```

Returns `True` if the user is looking to the right.

### Looking at the center

```python
gaze.is_center()
```

Returns `True` if the user is looking at the center.

### Horizontal direction of the gaze

```python
ratio = gaze.horizontal_ratio()
```

Returns a number between 0.0 and 1.0 that indicates the horizontal direction of the gaze. The extreme right is 0.0, the center is 0.5 and the extreme left is 1.0.

### Vertical direction of the gaze

```python
ratio = gaze.vertical_ratio()
```

Returns a number between 0.0 and 1.0 that indicates the vertical direction of the gaze. The extreme top is 0.0, the center is 0.5 and the extreme bottom is 1.0.

### Blinking

```python
gaze.is_blinking()
```

Returns `True` if the user's eyes are closed.

### Webcam frame

```python
frame = gaze.annotated_frame()
```

Returns the main frame with pupils highlighted.
